# Devbox Setup

- Start with [Bootstrap](bootstrap.md) and [Identity provisioning](identities.md).
- Isolate each identity in its own Unix user, home, credentials, and service state.

## Photos Analysis on macOS

Dotfiles apply disables `com.apple.photoanalysisd` for the current user on
macOS `devbox` and `personal-devbox` profiles. Existing analysis processes may
remain until logout. Workstation and developer profiles leave the setting alone.

This stops Photos background analysis, not iCloud Photos syncing, and deletes no
photos. Disable syncing separately in System Settings → Apple Account → iCloud
→ Photos → Sync this Mac. Other media and photo-library services remain enabled.

After switching away from a devbox profile, restore analysis explicitly if wanted:

```sh
launchctl enable gui/$(id -u)/com.apple.photoanalysisd
```

## Local Configuration

Optional per-user settings live in `~/.config/dotfiles/devbox.env`, mode `0600`:

```sh
DEVBOX_USER=example
T3_SERVICE=1
```

`T3_SERVICE=1` opts the user into the
[T3 Code background service](#system-services); a devbox identity reached only
through the desktop app's SSH launcher leaves it out.

- Resolve SOPS secrets only in the consuming process. Keep plaintext tokens out
  of shell startup, plists, and supervisor configuration.
- Human GitHub access uses personal SSH keys; unattended access should use
  repository-scoped GitHub App tokens over HTTPS and a separate commit identity.

## Sudo Without a Plaintext Password File

Store `SUDO_PASSWORD_AGE` in the user's SOPS payload. Encrypt that inner value to
a dedicated sudo age identity. Add these paths to the owner-only local config:

```sh
SOPS_SUDO_SECRET_FILE="$HOME/projects/example/vault/secrets/identity/user-sudo.sops.json"
SUDO_AGE_IDENTITY_FILE="$HOME/.config/dotfiles/sudo-age-identity.txt"
```

Run a fixed command, or leave the child unprivileged while allowing its own sudo
calls:

```zsh
./identity/sops-devbox-sudo.ts -- /bin/launchctl kickstart -k system/example.service
./identity/sops-devbox-sudo.ts --nested -- /path/to/service-restart.sh
```

The password is decrypted in the askpass process. A narrow sudoers allowlist
remains the authorization boundary.

## Opt-In Coding LLM Gateway

Personal profiles require `~/.config/dotfiles/llm-gateway.json`, mode `0600`.
Standard profiles can enroll explicitly. Obtain resolved credentials from the
owning private system. Start with this example and replace the credentials
and URLs:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "credentials": {
    "gatewai": "<resolved Gatewai key>",
    "bifrost": "<resolved Bifrost key>"
  },
  "gatewaiBaseUrl": "https://gatewai.example/v1",
  "bifrostBaseUrl": "https://bifrost.example/v1"
}
```

[`GatewayShape` and `parseGatewayConfig`](../agents/gateway/gateway-config.ts)
own optional fields and validation. Gatewai-only enrollment omits both
`credentials.bifrost` and `bifrostBaseUrl`; supplying only one is rejected. It
configures Codex and Claude through Gatewai without adding a Bifrost provider.
Existing unrelated provider settings are preserved. Run the Bifrost-specific
client commands below only when that provider is allocated.

Credentials stay in owner-only configuration
or client stores. Gateway state uses version 9; unsupported state must be migrated
before enrollment or maintenance.

```zsh
./bootstrap/configure-llm-gateway.ts
./bootstrap/configure-llm-gateway.ts --check
./bootstrap/configure-bifrost-clients.ts
./bootstrap/configure-bifrost-clients.ts --check
```

Gateway setup and maintenance preserve existing vendor logins. Grok enrollment
backs up its previous authentication for rollback. Sign out through each client's
own command when you no longer need its vendor login.

### Client Troubleshooting

- **Codex:** `codex login status` can report `Not logged in` with working
  command-based gateway auth. A live check is
  `echo ok | codex exec --ephemeral --skip-git-repo-check -` (uses provider quota).
  Harnesses using `--ignore-user-config` must launch
  `~/.local/libexec/dotfiles/codex-gatewai` to retain gateway routing.
- **Claude:** enrollment refuses conflicting `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, Bedrock, or Vertex settings. Resolve those deliberately
  before retrying.

### Rollback

```zsh
./bootstrap/configure-llm-gateway.ts --rollback
```

- Restores saved client configuration; removes helpers.
- Restores the saved Grok login when one existed before enrollment.

## System Services

On macOS, install Colima's boot service from an authorized administrator
account for the user who owns Colima:

```zsh
sudo ./bootstrap/darwin/install-devbox-service-daemons.ts --user example --colima
sudo ./bootstrap/darwin/install-devbox-service-daemons.ts --user example --colima --check
```

- Retire competing user LaunchAgents before installation.
- The service runs the user's own `~/.local/bin/colima-ensure`; dotfiles does
  not ship it. Make it exit 0 when `colima status` succeeds and otherwise run
  `colima start` with the host's sizing.
- Reference owner-only wrappers or files; never embed secrets.

Set `T3_SERVICE=1` in [local configuration](#local-configuration), then run
`./dotfiles apply` with the devbox profile to install the T3 Code service.
Unattended maintenance does not enroll new services. T3 owns later updates;
the [installation step](../bootstrap/install-t3-service.ts) preserves existing
units. Inspect it with:

```zsh
t3 service status
```

`./dotfiles check` proves the unit exists for opted-in users. On Linux it
also checks lingering and the running service's `PATH`. The systemd user
manager does not read shell startup files; for missing tools, follow
[bootstrap troubleshooting](bootstrap.md#troubleshooting). Enable lingering
as an administrator: `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>`.

Keep `--base-dir` stable across updates; see the upstream
[background service guide](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/main/docs/user/background-service.md).

### Refresh a Linux Service's PATH

Applying dotfiles updates the systemd user manager's `PATH`. An already-running
T3 service keeps its old environment until restarted. If the profile check
reports missing mise shims after a successful apply, run these commands as the
service's Unix user from the dotfiles checkout:

```sh
systemctl --user restart t3code.service
systemctl --user is-active t3code.service
./dotfiles check
```

Restarting can interrupt connected T3 sessions; finish active work first.
`daemon-reload` alone does not refresh a running process's environment.

### macOS Service Sessions

On macOS, keep the user logged in and the Mac awake; the LaunchAgent stops at
logout. Installing over SSH for a user with no GUI session writes the
LaunchAgent but cannot start it; the step reports the deferred start and the
service comes up at that user's next login, so a green apply does not by
itself prove the service is running.

## Software Updates and Cleanup

On macOS, enroll [headless updates](software-updates.md#headless-devbox-updates)
as the Homebrew owner to update packages and tools without a GUI login. On Linux, each user
enables the [systemd maintenance timer](software-updates.md#enable-and-use).

Use [Host hygiene](software-updates.md#host-hygiene) to preview cleanup,
protect active work, or apply removals with the updater idle.

## Verification

Run as the intended Unix user:

```zsh
./dotfiles check devbox # use personal-devbox for that profile
./verify/darwin/devbox-services.ts # macOS only
mise run audit devbox --format json
```

Audit prose can contain secrets. Collect JSON and report detector, path, and
line without copying matched values.

`./dotfiles check` verifies that macOS devbox profiles persistently disable
Photos analysis through launchd, even without `--desktop`. Missing or enabled
policy fails the check; use `./dotfiles apply` to restore it. This does not
change iCloud Photos sync. Workstation, developer, and Linux profiles are excluded.

For suspected leftover development services, use the read-only
[workload diagnostic](software-updates.md#development-workload-diagnostics).

## Replace a Mac Devbox

Enroll the new Mac as a separate deployment. Keep the old devbox working until
the new one passes every check below.

1. Set the final host name before enrolling anything that records it.
2. Follow [Bootstrap](bootstrap.md) as the new Homebrew owner with the old
   host's profile.
3. Create a new SSH key and [age identity](identities.md#move-or-retire-a-deployment)
   with a verified recovery copy. Obtain a separate gateway credential from its
   owner; do not copy the old host's.
4. On the old host, push or deliberately archive unpushed branches, stashes,
   worktrees, and ignored work. Clone repositories on the new host from their
   remotes. Never copy coding-agent logins, sessions, caches, or browser profiles.
5. Install [system services](#system-services) and enroll
   [headless updates](software-updates.md#headless-devbox-updates).
6. Run [verification](#verification), then each moved repository's own build
   and test gate on the new host.

Then retire the old host's services, updater, gateway credential, and age
recipient separately, each with its own proof.
