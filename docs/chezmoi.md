# Chezmoi Source State

Edit tracked files under [chezmoi/](../chezmoi/).
[Profile data](../chezmoi/.chezmoidata/profiles.json) selects their targets;
[apply-dotfiles.ts](../scripts/bootstrap/apply-dotfiles.ts) handles preview,
backups, and apply. Package installation belongs to Homebrew and runtime pins
to [mise](mise.md#runtime-pins).

## Workflow

For source-only changes, substitute the intended profile:

```zsh
mise trust
mise run dotfiles:diff workstation
mise run dotfiles:apply workstation
```

- `./dotfiles apply <profile>` also runs the remaining
  [bootstrap steps](bootstrap.md).
- Both preview and apply refresh [agent rules](agents.md#global-rules),
  including during a dry run.
- The wrapper backs up conflicting files and links before force-applying,
  keeping only the newest backup per target.
- Global agent rule files are replaced without backups; private text belongs
  in [rule fragments](agents.md#global-rules).

For changes to apply behavior, run the isolated fixtures rather than applying
to your home:

```zsh
mise run verify:domain config
mise run verify:domain profiles
node scripts/verify/home-fixture.ts
```

## Local Overrides

| Path | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.ssh/config.local` | Host-specific SSH directives |
| `~/.ssh/config.d/*.conf` | Fragments written by other tools |
| `~/.config/dotfiles/zshenv.local` | Machine-specific, non-secret shell exports |
| `~/.config/dotfiles/agents.start.md`, `agents.end.md` | Private agent rules |

- SSH includes Colima's generated `~/.colima/ssh_config`. Route writers to
  their own fragments rather than modifying `~/.ssh/config`.
- Create `zshenv.local` manually with mode `0600`. The shell reads it only as
  a readable regular file; symlinks at the file or its `dotfiles` directory
  are ignored. Keep service tokens out of shell startup.
- `TELEPORT_ADD_KEYS_TO_AGENT=no` can prevent Teleport from adding keys to an
  incompatible SSH agent.
- The [Claude settings modifier](../chezmoi/private_dot_claude/modify_private_settings.json)
  changes selected defaults while preserving other fields, including `env`.
  Provider routing belongs to the [gateway configurator](devbox.md#opt-in-coding-llm-gateway).

## Source Boundaries

- Keep private identities, host data, credentials, and local overrides out of Git.
- Use `private_` for owner-only files and directories.
- Do not use `exact_` at home-directory scope or import live app/auth state with
  `chezmoi add`.
- Add lifecycle scripts only when an explicit bootstrap requirement needs them;
  keep package lists and runtime installation in their existing owners.
