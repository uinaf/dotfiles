# Bootstrap Guide

Run commands from the repository root as the target Unix user. Choose a
[profile](profiles.md#choose-a-profile) first.

## First-Time Prerequisites

### Linux (Ubuntu)

The host owns root-level packages: `git`, `curl`, `zsh`, `tmux`, `mise` on
the system PATH, and the login shell set to `zsh`. A managed devbox gets those
from its provisioning; elsewhere:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y git curl zsh tmux lynis age
# sops has no Ubuntu package; the host installs the release binary for its
# architecture on the fixed path the sudo askpass helper resolves. A managed
# devbox gets this from its provisioning, which owns the version pin.
sops_version=3.13.3
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/local/bin/sops "https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v${sops_version}/sops-v${sops_version}.linux.$(dpkg --print-architecture)"
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/sops
curl https://mise.run | sh   # installs ~/.local/bin/mise
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh "$USER"
mkdir -p ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/uinaf/dotfiles.git ~/projects/dotfiles
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
./dotfiles prepare
```

Skip the Homebrew steps below; `gh auth login` comes after the first apply
installs `gh`. `workstation` profiles are macOS-only; `./dotfiles apply`
refuses them here, so use `developer` or `devbox`.

The `devbox` profiles also expect two host-provided prerequisites, both
probed by `./dotfiles check devbox`:

- Tailscale installed and joined.
- systemd lingering for the user: `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>`. The
  [maintenance timer](software-updates.md) and the
  [T3 Code service](devbox.md#system-services) stop at logout without it.

Tool pins live in the [mise configuration](mise.md#runtime-pins).
`age` and `sops` stay host packages on both platforms because the
[sudo askpass helper](../identity/sudo-age-askpass.sh) calls them by fixed path.
For per-user SDK setup, follow [Mobile and TV development](mobile-and-tv-development.md).

### macOS

Install Apple Command Line Tools and Homebrew:

```zsh
xcode-select --install
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Install the clone tools and prepare the checkout; `gh auth login` follows the
first apply, which installs `gh` through mise:

```zsh
brew install git mise
mkdir -p ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/uinaf/dotfiles.git ~/projects/dotfiles
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
./dotfiles prepare
export PATH="$(mise --no-config where node@"$(cat .node-version)")/bin:$PATH"
```

Run Homebrew commands as the user who owns its prefix.

`prepare` installs the pinned Node runtime and locked repository dependencies.

### Gitless First Fetch

If Git is unavailable, fetch an archive to inspect and bootstrap:

```zsh
mkdir -p ~/projects
curl -fL https://github.com/uinaf/dotfiles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
  -o /tmp/dotfiles-main.zip
ditto -x -k /tmp/dotfiles-main.zip ~/projects
mv ~/projects/dotfiles-main ~/projects/dotfiles
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
```

Install Homebrew and mise, then run `prepare` and the Node `PATH` export above.
Once Git and `gh` work, move the archive aside and clone into a fresh directory
before using Git updates or contribution commands.

## Apply a Profile

Before applying a personal profile, provision the owner-only
[LLM gateway config](devbox.md#opt-in-coding-llm-gateway). Personal setup retires
saved coding-client logins except those listed in `preservedLogins`.

```zsh
profile=workstation # choose your profile
./homebrew/brew-bundle.ts "$profile" # macOS only
mise trust
./dotfiles diff "$profile"
./dotfiles apply "$profile"
./identity/configure-git.ts --profile "$profile"
```

- Configure [Git authorship and local SSH keys](identities.md#developer-git-and-ssh)
  from explicit operator values.
- On macOS, install [the pinned Xcode](mobile-and-tv-development.md) with
  `mise run xcode:install`.
- Provision a [backed-up SOPS age identity](identities.md#sops-age-identity)
  when the profile's `requiresSopsIdentity` capability is set or you consume secrets.
- For machine-specific Homebrew packages, add a gitignored
  [local Brewfile](profiles.md#local-homebrew-additions).
- For externally supplied Homebrew packages or refused tap trust, configure
  [external capabilities](profiles.md#externally-managed-homebrew-capabilities).

On macOS, run these host-wide steps once from the administrator account:

```zsh
./bootstrap/darwin/configure-power.ts --profile "$profile"
./bootstrap/darwin/configure-spotlight.ts
```

Power configuration disables sleep while plugged in and leaves battery settings
unchanged. Spotlight configuration disables indexing on mounted volumes without
removing existing index data.

### Spotlight Policy

On macOS, profile checks require Spotlight indexing to be disabled by default.
If indexing is intentional, omit the `configure-spotlight.ts` setup step and
skip its verification with:

```zsh
DOTFILES_SKIP_SPOTLIGHT_CHECK=1 ./dotfiles check "$profile"
```

For subsequent checks, export `DOTFILES_SKIP_SPOTLIGHT_CHECK=1` in your
machine-local [`~/.config/dotfiles/zshenv.local`](chezmoi.md#local-overrides).
Checks report the policy as skipped and leave indexing unchanged. `apply` does
not configure Spotlight. An explicit
`./bootstrap/darwin/configure-spotlight.ts` still disables indexing and verifies
the result, even with this flag set.

### Workstation Options

- Install licensed Berkeley Mono Variable manually; Ghostty falls back to Menlo.
- On `personal-workstation`, run `./bootstrap/darwin/app-store/personal.ts` to remove
  the unused bundled App Store apps; uninstall may prompt for a password.
- Quit Chrome before running `./bootstrap/darwin/configure-chrome.ts` to apply
  Lens policies and the vertical-tabs setting.
- Workstation setup enables vertical tabs in every existing Helium user profile,
  or seeds `Default` before first launch. Quit Helium before setup or run
  `./bootstrap/darwin/configure-helium.ts` afterward. Scheduled maintenance defers
  this step while Helium is running and retries at its next run. New profiles
  receive the setting on the next setup or maintenance run with Helium closed.
  Other preferences, including the sidebar side, stay unchanged. The setting uses
  [Helium's profile layout preference](https://github.com/imputnet/helium/blob/main/patches/helium/ui/layout/core.patch).
- For simulators, SDKs, and signing certificates, follow
  [Mobile and TV development](mobile-and-tv-development.md).

### Devbox Options

Follow [Devbox setup](devbox.md) for services and secret consumers. On macOS,
the logged-in owner may apply the optional desktop baseline:

```zsh
./bootstrap/darwin/configure-desktop.ts
./verify/bootstrap.ts --profile devbox --desktop
```

### Verify

Run as each intended Unix user:

```zsh
mise run maintenance:check
./dotfiles check "$profile"
mise run audit host
```

For workstations, also run `mise run audit workstation`. For devbox profiles:

```zsh
./verify/darwin/devbox-services.ts # macOS only
mise run audit devbox
```

## Homebrew Updates

Homebrew manages packages directly for the Mac's owner.

Enroll [headless updates](software-updates.md#headless-devbox-updates) for
scheduled execution without a GUI session.

## Updating an Existing Machine

When upgrading from the former `scripts/` layout, first follow the
[one-time scheduler migration](software-updates.md#upgrading-from-the-scripts-layout).
Installed jobs must stop before the checkout moves and be re-enrolled afterward.
Once they are stopped, continue below.

Refresh the checkout:

```zsh
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
git pull --ff-only
```

Follow [Apply a profile](#apply-a-profile) with the installed role, including
its verification step. Personal `apply` retires unpreserved coding-client logins. Unattended
[convergence](software-updates.md#dotfiles-convergence) uses `./dotfiles maintain`,
which preserves [gateway client logins](devbox.md#opt-in-coding-llm-gateway).
For package-only refreshes, use
[Software updates](software-updates.md).
